# know_your_medicine

Now knowing each and every details of the medicines becomes a lot easier, just scan the prescription and we'll tell you the necessary details of the medicine.

This idea is initiated in RCubed's Hackathon 1.0

When the user runs medicine_details.py, then with the help of OCR the name of the medicine gets extracted from the image and then it crawls the "www.drugs.com" to extract the medicine details.

Right now the script prints the first 4 paragraph from the drugs.com.
